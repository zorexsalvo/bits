# Business Issue Tracking System

## Requirements:
 - >= python2.7
 - Django 1.10
 - virtual environment
 
# To view the template/design:
 1. Clone or Download this repository and extract the zip.
 2. Open folder issue_tracking/maintenance/templates/.
 3. Right + click login.html and click Open With Browser.
 

# To Run the Server:
 1. On command line open the folder.
 2. Create a virtual environment via command `virtualenv -p python2.7 venv`.
 3. Activate the virtual environment via command `. venv/bin/activate`.
 4. Check the commandline when you saw `(venv)` before the machine name that's when you know that you're
    already using the virtual environment.
 5. When you are already on the virtual environment, type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 6. After the download, type `cd issue-tracking`.
 7. Then run the command `python manage.py runserver`.

# Notes:
  > I will simplify those commands soon when the project is almost finished.
